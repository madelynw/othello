Caltech CS2 Assignment 9: Othello

We worked together on coding. May worked on the constructor and coding the
AI to make valid moves. Madelyn coded the AI to beat SimplePlayer. We worked 
on the heuristics together.

We looked up board strategies for the most valuable squares. We also tested
for the best weights that would make our AI win most of the time. It's important
to control the key positions on the board and to not put pieces down in places
where the opponent can get a lot of points.
